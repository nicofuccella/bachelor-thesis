	abstract = {Verification of C/C<bold>++</bold> programs has seen considerable progress in several areas, but not for programs that use these languages' mathematical libraries. The reason is that all libraries in widespread use come with no guarantees about the computed results. This would seem to prevent any attempt at formal verification of programs that use them: without a specification for the functions, no conclusion can be drawn statically about the behavior of the program. We propose an alternative to surrender. We introduce a pragmatic approach that leverages the fact that most <monospace>math.h/cmath</monospace> functions are almost piecewise monotonic: as we discovered through exhaustive testing, they may have glitches, often of very small size and in small numbers. We develop interval refinement techniques for such functions based on a modified dichotomic search, which enable verification via symbolic execution based model checking, abstract interpretation, and test data generation. To the best of our knowledge, our refinement algorithms are the first in the literature to be able to handle non-correctly rounded function implementations, enabling verification in the presence of the most common implementations. We experimentally evaluate our approach on real-world code, showing its ability to detect or rule out anomalous behaviors.},

              providing world-leading best practice guidelines for the
              safe and secure application of both embedded control
              systems and standalone software. MISRA C is a coding
              standard defining a subset of the C language, initially
              targeted at the automotive sector, but now adopted
              across all industry sectors that develop C software in
              safety- and/or security-critical contexts. In this
              paper, we introduce MISRA C, its role in the development
              of critical software, especially in embedded systems,
              its relevance to industry safety standards, as well as
              the challenges of working with a general-purpose

              language with a slow evolution over the last 40+
              years. We also outline the role of static analysis in
              the automatic checking of compliance with respect to
              MISRA C, and the role of the MISRA C language subset in
              enabling a wider application of formal methods to
              industrial software written in C.",

              task: doing so in unrestricted C is even more
              challenging.  C~is a general-purpose programming
              language, partially defined by an ISO standard written
              in natural language with a slow evolution over the last
              40+ years.  Its many strong points make it the most used
              language for the development of embedded systems.
              Unfortunately, the origin of C's strength is also the
              origin of C's weakness: the language has many aspects
              that are not fully defined, it has some rather obscure
              aspects that can easily induce programmers into error,
              and it has no run-time error detection facilities.
              MISRA C is a coding standard defining a subset of the C
              language, initially targeted at the automotive sector,
              but now adopted across all industry sectors that develop

              development of critical embedded systems' software and
              its relevance to industry safety and security standards.
              We explain why and how MISRA C retains 95\% of the
              advantages of C and eradicates 95\% of its drawbacks:
              with the right tools, training and professional
              expertise, the adoption of MISRA C, besides satisfying
              some important requirements imposed by safety standards,
              can significantly decrease development times and
              costs.",

  Abstract = "The \emph{Barr Group's Embedded~C Coding Standard}
              (BARR-C:2018, which originates from the 2009 Netrino's
              Embedded~C Coding Standard) is, for coding standards
              used by the embedded system industry, second only in
              popularity to MISRA~C.  However, the choice between
              MISRA~C:2012 and BARR-C:2018 needs not be a hard
              decision since they are complementary in two quite
              different ways.  On the one hand, BARR-C:2018 has
              removed all the incompatibilities with respect to
              MISRA~C:2012 that were present in the previous edition
              (BARR-C:2013). As a result, disregarding programming
              style, BARR-C:2018 defines a subset of C that, while
              preventing a significant number of programming errors,
              is larger than the one defined by MISRA C:2012. On the
              other hand, concerning programming style, whereas MISRA
              C leaves this to individual organizations, BARR-C:2018
              defines a programming style aimed primarily at
              minimizing programming errors.  As a result, BARR-C:2018
              can be seen as a first, dramatically useful step to C
              language subsetting that is suitable for all kinds of
              projects; critical projects can then evolve toward
              MISRA~C:2012 compliance smoothly while maintaining the
              BARR-C programming style.  In this paper, we introduce
              BARR-C:2018, we describe its relationship with
              MISRA~C:2012, and we discuss the parallel and serial
              adoption of the two coding standards.",

  Journal = "Constraints",
  Year = 2022,
  Month = feb,
  Abstract = "Verification of programs using floating-point arithmetic
              is challenging on several accounts. One of the
              difficulties of reasoning about such programs is due to
              the peculiarities of floating-point arithmetic: rounding
              errors, infinities, non-numeric objects (NaNs), signed
              zeroes, denormal numbers, different rounding modes,
              etc. One possibility to reason about floating-point
              arithmetic is to model a program computation path by
              means of a set of ternary constraints of the form and
              use constraint propagation techniques to infer new
              information on the variables' possible values. In this
              setting, we define and prove the correctness of
              algorithms to precisely bound the value of one of the
              variables x, y or z, starting from the bounds known for
              the other two. We do this for each of the operations and
              for each rounding mode defined by the IEEE 754 binary
              floating-point standard, even in the case the rounding
              mode in effect is only partially known. This is the
              first time that such so-called filtering algorithms are
              defined and their correctness is formally proved. This
              is an important slab for paving the way to formal
              verification of programs that use floating-point
              arithmetics.",

  Abstract = "MISRA~C is the most authoritative language subset for
             the C programming language that is a de facto standard in
             several industry sectors where safety and security are of
             paramount importance.  While MISRA~C is currently encoded
             in 175 guidelines (coding rules and directives), it does
             not coincide with them: proper adoption of MISRA~C
             requires embracing its preventive approach (as opposed to
             the ``bug finding'' approach) and a documented
             development process where justifiable non-compliances are
             authorized and recorded as \emph{deviations}.  MISRA~C
             guidelines are classified along several axes in the
             official MISRA documents.  In this paper, we add to these
             an orthogonal classification that associates guidelines
             with their main rationale.  The advantages of this new
             classification are illustrated for different kinds of
             projects, including those not (yet) having MISRA
             compliance among their objectives.",
